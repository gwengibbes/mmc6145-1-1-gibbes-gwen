      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div>My aim is to enter the world of design and web design combining the skills that I learned in my first career with my new skills in design and web design. As a retired teacher, continuing my learning was an essential part of my journey. I am currently completing my masterâ€™s degree at the University of Florida in Web Design and Online Communications. I am excited to put all that I have learned into practice designing and making functioning websites. </div>
